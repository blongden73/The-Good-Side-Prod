The Good Side is a purpose-driven social enterprise. We reinvest profit for purpose, and our commercial projects fund our social change work. We take a more sustainable approach to capitalism, delivering and measuring a triple bottom line: for people, planet and prosperity. 

We aim to create an enabling, inclusive and open culture for our team, while also pushing ourselves to keep innovating and excelling in what we do. 

We regularly measure how we live up to our standards, and we are proud of the networks we contribute to.
