Intro: Improving travel experience for LGBTQI+ people with Booking.Com
Question: What is the LGBTQI+ travel experience like, and how might we help LGBTQI+
  travelers make travel plans in a safe and welcoming way?
The Work Description: Through traveler diaries and discussion groups in UK, Germany,
  and Netherlands, we built a deep understanding of LGBTQI+ traveler journeys, which
  we then validated in a robust quant survey. We identified barriers and drivers throughout
  the customer journey, and workshopped a range of initiatives to help evolve booking.comâ€™s
  offer for LGBTQI+ customers.
