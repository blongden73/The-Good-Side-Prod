Intro: Creating a new day for positive remembrance
Question: How can we kick start a movement to encourage death positivity through celebratory
  remembrance?
The Work Description: "We designed a cultural strategy process to surface fresh insight
  and drive creative development. We immersed ourselves in memorial behaviours, learned
  from lived experience and explored existing social practices around death. We convened
  a creative community to help us invent new rituals and kick start a movement.\n\nWe
  discovered a rich and growing seam of death positivity at the margins of culture.
  From death cafés to immersive artwork, from memorial skate parks to nature therapy,
  death is having a moment in popular culture - and the time felt right to build a
  wider movement. \n\nWe soaked up a raft of inspiration from the diverse people we
  met as part of our research journey, and brought this to life in an insight film
  - telling stories of love, loss, acts of death positivity and remembrance. The film
  became a tool to engage partners as we crafted cultural strategy. \n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25%

  collaborated with inspiring people across the UK who had experienced loss and turned
  it into a sense of purpose. The beautiful films, 1 hero and 7 personal stories,
  showed a diverse range of people and experiences, capturing the bittersweet nature
  of remembrance and driving social and PR engagement.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/717626726?h=a7878c52f3&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\"

The insight Description: |
  We created a new moment in the cultural calendar, instilling a new behaviour in the public consciousness.  Our campaign invited people to make time to pause, reflect and celebrate someone they’ve loved and lost. We modelled ways in which they invokes their memories of loved ones, in a way that resonated personally, and to share those actions.
