Intro: Reigniting a belief in aid with an alliance of charities
Question: How can we tell a new story about international aid, to reverse the decline
  in UK donations?
The Work Description: |-
  We identified a core British audience who have disengaged from supporting international development – a group we labelled Conscientious Cynics – to robustly understand their misgivings and stay myopically audience-focused with our campaign output.

  Uniting a core group of specialist partner agencies across branding, creative, media and PR, we co-created a sector-wide brand and narrative, campaign film and [website](https://wethehelpers.com/) - reframing aid as help.

The insight Description: Set up as a live ‘test and learn’ experiment in cultural
  innovation, we delivered a full campaign analysis with clear sector recommendations
  to deepen the story further and reverse the decades of decline in public support.
