Intro: Reigniting a belief in aid with a alliance of charities
Question: How can we tell a new story about international aid, to reverse the decline
  in UK donations?
The Work: "We identified a core British audience who have disengaged from supporting
  international development – a group we labelled Conscientious Cynics – to robustly
  understand their misgivings and stay myopically audience-focused with our campaign
  output.\n\nUniting a core group of specialist partner agencies across branding,
  creative, media and PR, we co-created a sector-wide brand and narrative, campaign
  film and website - reframing aid as help. "
The Impact: Set up as a live ‘test and learn’ experiment in cultural innovation, we
  delivered a full campaign analysis with clear sector recommendations to deepen the
  story further and reverse the decades of decline in public support. Watch this space
  for more when we complete our MEL.
