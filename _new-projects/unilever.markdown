Intro: Celebrating the impact of market-based solutions with Unilever & FDCO
Question: How can we demonstrate the impact of applying market-based solutions to
  some of the world’s biggest development challenges? What impact has the unique TRANSFORM
  partnership between Unilever and the UK Government had on the social enterprises
  it supports?
The Work Description: We partnered with MLS to fuel a multi-channel communications
  strategy aimed at inspiring engagement with Unilever and UK FCDO’s TRANSFORM programme.
  Through place-based ethnographic research and systems mapping, we uncovered the
  human stories and social impact that TRANSFORM social enterprises were making across
  East Africa and Bangladesh, and the benefit those organisations gained from working
  with Unilever teams on sales and marketing strategy.
The insight Description: Our storytelling, photography and evaluation content served
  to position TRANSFORM as a leading example of a public private partnership, encouraging
  and equipping other partners to replicate and invest in the model. Since the engagement
  strategy, many more partners have joined TRANSFORM, including Microsoft, Acumen,
  LinkedIn and GSMA.
