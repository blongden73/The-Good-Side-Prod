Intro: Inspiring reusable coffee cup use with Starbucks & Hubbub
Question: Which behavioural levers could we pull to inspire and enable reusable coffee
  cup use?
The Work Description: We used our behavioural design process to explore consumer attitudes
  and behaviours around sustainability, informing campaign strategies to promote reusable
  coffee cup use. Through ethnography, user diaries, industry interviews, cultural
  and social media analysis we unpacked the contemporary sustainability movement,
  and identified narratives and intervention sites to help shift behaviours.
The insight Description: Adopting decision science levers and user personas from our
  research, we wrote creative briefs for agencies tasked with developing campaign
  ideas. Regional trial campaigns were launched in Manchester, Bristol and Leeds based
  on our behavioural insights.
