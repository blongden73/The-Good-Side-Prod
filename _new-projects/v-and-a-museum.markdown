Intro: Inspiring a more inclusive experience for the Black community with the V&A
Question: How can we create inspiring campaigns that go beyond marketing to build
  lasting and meaningful relationships with the Black community and improve creative
  access?
The Work Description: |-
  This six-week engagement brought together some influential Ambassadors from the community and a group of energised and enthusiastic V&A staff for an immersive workshop to get a better understanding of this exciting and underserved audience. We used the rich insight surfaced from the difficult conversations on the night to craft a creative strategy that could spark change for the museum; mapping out a journey towards becoming a more inclusive and welcoming space for non-white audiences starting with the campaign for its upcoming Africa Fashion exhibit.
