Intro: Inspiring ECD donors to prioritise mums, with The Kays Foundation
Question: How can we encourage the Early Child Education and Development community
  to think about the caregiver as much as the child in investment and programme strategies?
The Work Description: |-
  A month-long ethnographic immersion and documentary film production, guided by a literature review and expert interviews and backed up with a quantitative survey. We workshopped insights and conclusions with The Kays Foundation, the Keynan government and NGO stakeholders to ensure outputs were owned and co-created with people who could act on them. An [interactive report](#) to accompany the documentary film helped bring all of the thinking together, and live on beyond the project.

The insight Description: Through a series of stakeholder sessions and workshops we
  secured commitments from key ECD donors to revise their funding strategies to focus
  on designing for caregiverâ€™s needs - representing over $10m in investment, mainly
  for mothers. Our film has become a key training tool for ECD programme design workshops,
  and is used as a case study for the Dignified Storytelling Alliance.
