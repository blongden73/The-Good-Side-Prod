Intro: Changing young men's mental health with Movember
Question: How are masculinity and mental health affecting lower-income and ethnically
  diverse young men in the UK, Canada and Australia, and can we shift these social
  norms through an integrated change strategy?
The Work Description: |-
  We created a six-month digital research community to capture young men's personal lives and intimate thoughts. Mining a rich seam of user generated content and survey data, we delved deeply into their behaviours and attitudes, surfacing a wealth of insight. From this deep understanding we crafted a behaviour and social change strategy, centred on harnessing the power of social media to effect change.

The insight Description: Our insight and strategy drove media interventions in UK,
  Canada and Australia. In the UK, our briefing film mobilised top YouTube influencers
  to create 16 films that attracted over 10 million views and delivered proven positive
  behaviour change outcomes, an in award winning campaign. In Canada, almost 2.5 million
  men engaged with The Mental Game, a new multimedia format linking sports to mental
  resilience, with proven impact on self care habits. Australia campaign coming soonâ€¦
