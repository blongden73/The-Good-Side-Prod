Intro: Understanding how to influence the government with WaterAid
Question: How can we encourage the UK Government to invest in Water, Sanitation and
  Hygiene (WASH) projects in the face of significant aid budget cuts?
The Work Description: WaterAid asked us to explore ways to influence the Johnson administration
  in order to achieve maximum impact. We designed a systems mapping approach to understand
  contemporary political influence and workshop strategic solutions. Through interviews
  with high level decision makers, political strategists, media linchpins and opinion
  leaders, an analysis of successful influencing campaigns and a network mapping process
  we were able to identify key opportunities and relationships for WaterAid, and propose
  narrative and strategic approaches to reach the heart of government.
The insight Description: Our network mapping and communications strategy has kick-started
  a new organisational approach to building influencing strategies within WaterAid.
