Case study title: 'Co-creating youth media brands for behaviour change with Girl Effect. '
Question: What can we learn about gender norms for young people, and how can branded
  media change the status quo?
Blocks:
- Article text: "We have collaborated with Girl Effect over eight years to help them
    launch youth media brands in Rwanda, Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania and India, designed
    to shift social norms around gender. \n\nWe defined and crafted the Girl Effect
    global strategy on using brands and media for cultural change, writing their Theory
    of Change and a white paper to share with funders and technical partners.\n\nOver
    nearly a decade we have helped Girl Effect teams understand everyday life for
    young women and girls, and explored social norms around gender and identity through
    ethnographic immersion, media studies, participatory research methods and rich
    documentary outputs.\n"
