    launch youth media brands in Rwanda, Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania and India, designed
    to shift social norms around gender. \n\nWe defined and crafted the Girl Effect
    global strategy on using brands and media for cultural change, writing their Theory
    of Change and a white paper to share with funders and technical partners.\n\nOver
    nearly a decade we have helped Girl Effect team understand everyday life for young
    women and girls, and social norms around gender and identity through ethnographic
    immersion, media studies, participatory research methods and rich documentary
    outputs.\n"
