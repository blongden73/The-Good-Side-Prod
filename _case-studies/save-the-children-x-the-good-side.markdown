- Article text: |2

    We worked with Save the Children to help them understand their donor audiences and drive growth as a charity and funder. Through remote self-ethnography, depth interviews, documentary filming and workshopping, we helped them understand the needs of their audiences, the context of community life, and a strategy on how to effectively target and support them.
    We created three films, persona booklets and immersive tools for the comms teams to bring their audience segments into their workstreams.
