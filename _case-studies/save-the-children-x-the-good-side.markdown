Case study title: Bringing audiences to life through ethnography, documentary and
  design processes for Save The Children
Question: How can we better target and support Save The Children's key audiences?
Blocks:
- Article text: "We worked with Save the Children to help them understand their donor
    audiences and drive growth as a charity and funder. \n\nThrough remote self-ethnography,
    depth interviews, documentary filming and design-focused workshopping, we helped
    Save The Children better understand the needs of their key audiences, and workshop
    strategies on how to effectively target and support them.\n\nWe created a suite
    of films, persona booklets, large format posters and immersive tools that could
    live within the organisation as a permanent shortcut into the lives of their audience
    segments.\n"
