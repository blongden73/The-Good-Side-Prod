Case study title: 'In partnership with creative collective Glimpse, we used our behavioural
  design process to explore consumer attitudes and behaviours around sustainability,
  informing campaign strategies to promote reusable coffee cup use. '
Question: How do we get more British people to adopt reusable coffee cups, and save
  150 million single-use coffee cups from landfill?
Blocks:
- Article text: "Through ethnographies, user diaries, industry interviews, cultural
    and social media analysis we unpacked the contemporary sustainability movement,
    and identified narratives and intervention sites to help shift behaviours. \nAdopting
    decision science levers and user personas from our research, we developed creative
    briefs for Glimpse and partner agencies tasked with inventing campaign ideas.
    \n\nWe attended the London Coffee Festival to interview reusable cup vendors about
    the market and consumer behaviours, and made a short film about what we found.\n\n"
