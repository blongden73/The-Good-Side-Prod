Case study title: 'Building more open businesses: supporting the progression of LGBQT+
  people through inclusive company practices'
Question: How are LGBT+ people represented at senior levels of FTSE companies?
Blocks:
- Article text: "We were commissioned by the Financial Reporting Council to understand
    LGBTQ+ inclusion at senior levels in FTSE 100 and 250 companies, to examine the
    ways in which corporate culture both supports and fails people across a spectrum
    of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThrough an extensive literature
    review, in-depth interviews with LGBTQ+ leaders and inclusion experts, and a series
    of deliberative workshops, our research explored and surfaced important implications
    for the development of inclusive company policies and practices.\n\nOur report
    was launched at a webinar co-hosted by The Good Side and the FRC, with guest speakers
    from Amazon, Santander and Global Butterflies. \n"
