Case study title: Understanding the LGBTQ+ travel experience.
Question: How might we help LGBTQ+ travelers make travel plans in a safe and welcoming
  way?
Blocks:
- Article text: Booking.com wanted to better serve the LGBTQ+ community as part of
    their mission to ‘make life easier for everyone to experience the world’. We helped
    them identify the barriers and opportunities to subtly improve travel for the
    LGBTQ+ community. Guided by real-life experiences told in qualitative focus groups
    in the UK, Germany, and Netherlands, and later validated in a quantitative study,
    we were proud to be part of moulding a more inclusive travel experience for LGBTQ+
    people.
