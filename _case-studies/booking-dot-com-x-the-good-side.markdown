Case study title: Understanding the LGBTQ+ travel experience.
Question: How might we help LGBTQ+ travelers make travel plans in a safe and welcoming
  way?
Blocks:
- Article text: "Booking.com wanted to better serve the LGBTQ+ community as part of
    their mission to ‘make life easier for everyone to experience the world’. \n\nWe
    helped Booking.com identify the barriers and opportunities to subtly improve travel
    for the LGBTQ+ community, starting with the online customer journey and progressing
    to consider the entire travel experience, from checkin to arrival home. \n\nInspired
    by LGBTQ+ traveler's holiday photos and anecdotes, explored further qualitative
    focus groups in the UK, Germany, and Netherlands, and later validated in a quantitative
    study, we were proud to be part of shaping a more inclusive travel experience
    for LGBTQ+ people."
  Testimonial: "“If you are interested in doing similar work, research is your best
    starting point & I can't speak highly enough of our partner agency The Good Side.
