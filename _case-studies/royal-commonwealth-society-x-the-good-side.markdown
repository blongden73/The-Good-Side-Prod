  Article text: "We wanted to create a groundswell of youth noise to impact global
    leaders attending CHOGM 2020, and highlight the need to urgently reform discriminatory
    colonial era laws. \n\nWe created six short campaign films in collaboration with
    12 young activists from across the Commonwealth, to share their stories and amplify
    their voices to the growing movement for change.\n\nOur aim was to emotionally
    connect global youth audiences to the campaign through individual stories and
    beautiful imagery that celebrated and amplified these incredible activists, young
    people determined to create change for the next generation across the Commonwealth."
