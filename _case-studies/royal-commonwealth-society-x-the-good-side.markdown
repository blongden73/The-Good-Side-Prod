  Article text: "Creating a groundswell of youth noise to impact leaders attending
    CHOGM 2020. \n\nWe produced six short campaign films in collaboration with 12
    young activists from across the Commonwealth.\n\nScripted with the activists,
    two films acted as a “call to arms” for young people to get behind the campaign
    to reform discriminatory legislation.\n\nThis audience needed to be emotionally
    connected to the campaign through individual stories and beautiful images that
    celebrated and amplified these incredible young people."
