    "The Good Side was a delight to work with. Their multi-disciplinary team is equipped with the skills, empathy and sensitivity to work strategically in a variety of environments. They were able to integrate multiple rounds of feedback into a complicated project, and deliver a unique and important piece of work that has already created impact in a short space of time"
    Genevieve Wastie, Consultant at The Kays Foundation

    “Wow – just watched your Mama Kwanza video from Kilifi and Mombasa on mothers and their children under 3... It is such a powerful video, with clear messages, a strong narrative, great pictures etc etc. I found it heart breaking – and very authentic. It paints a very accurate picture of how it is for mothers and their children on the coast. And it needs to be seen by people who make decisions that affect the lives of the children and the parents. Well done, it is great work.”
    Sarah Forde - Communication consultant, based in coastal Kenya for 20 years.
