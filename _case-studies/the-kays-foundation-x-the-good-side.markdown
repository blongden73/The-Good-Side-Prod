Case study title: 
Question: How can we encourage early childhood programme designers to think about
  the caregiver as much as the child?

- Article text: "**A year-long mixed methods project to understand early childhood
    and parenting in coastal Kenya.\n**\n\nA literature review and expert interviews
    fed into a month-long ethnographic immersion and documentary film, backed up with
    a qualitative survey. Full insights and film at tkfinsights2019.org\n\nWe workshopped
    insights and conclusions with Kays and government and NGO stakeholders to ensure
    outputs were owned and co-created with people who could act on them.  \n"

    "The Good Side was a delight to work with. Their multi-disciplinary team is equipped with the skills, empathy and sensitivity to work strategically in a variety of environments. They were able to integrate multiple rounds of feedback into a complicated project, and deliver a unique and important piece of work that has already created impact in a short space of time"

    “Wow – just watched your Mama Kwanza video from Kilifi and Mombasa on mothers and their children under 3... It is such a powerful video, with clear messages, a strong narrative, great pictures etc etc. I found it heart breaking – and very authentic. It paints a very accurate picture of how it is for mothers and their children on the coast. And it needs to be seen by people who make decisions that affect the lives of the children and the parents. Well done, it is great work.”
    Sarah Forde - Communication consultant, based in coastal Kenya for 20 years.
