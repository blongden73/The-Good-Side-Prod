Case study title: A year-long mixed methods project to understand early childhood
  and parenting in coastal Kenya.
Question: How can we encourage early childhood programme designers to think about
  the caregiver as much as the child?

- Article text: "We conducted a year-long mixed methods project with Kays Foundation
    to understand early childhood and parenting in coastal Kenya.\n\nA literature
    review and expert interviews led to a month-long ethnographic immersion and powerful
    documentary film, validated and evidenced through a quantitative survey. \n\nWe
    workshopped insights and conclusions with Kays Foundation and local government
    and NGO stakeholders, to ensure the outputs were owned and co-created with people
    who could truly act on them. \n\nWe built a microsite to house our report and
    documentary, so it could act as an ongoing source of insight and guidance for
    anybody involved in Early Child Development.\n"

  Testimonial: '"The Good Side was a delight to work with. Their multi-disciplinary
    team is equipped with the skills, empathy and sensitivity to work strategically
    in a variety of environments. They were able to integrate multiple rounds of feedback
    into a complicated project, and deliver a unique and important piece of work that
    has already created impact in a short space of time" — Genevieve Wastie, Consultant
    at The Kays Foundation'

- Testimonial: "“Wow – just watched your Mama Kwanza video from Kilifi and Mombasa
    on mothers and their children under 3... It is such a powerful video, with clear
    messages, a strong narrative, great pictures etc etc. I found it heart breaking
    – and very authentic. It paints a very accurate picture of how it is for mothers
    and their children on the coast. And it needs to be seen by people who make decisions
    that affect the lives of the children and the parents. Well done, it is great
    work.” — Sarah Forde. Communication consultant, based in coastal Kenya for 20
    years."
