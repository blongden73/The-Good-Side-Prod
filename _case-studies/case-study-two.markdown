- Article text: "In the first week of widespread global lockdown we decided to create
    a documentary series exploring the social impact of COVID-19 on Britain.\n\nChosen
    for the BFIâ€™s Britain in Lockdown series of the best online videos made during
    the pandemic. \n\n\nIn The Corona Diaries we brought to life a diverse range of
    experiences, giving voice to people in different situations to tell their stories.
    In making the series we have seen marked shifts in attitudes, behaviours, values
    and priorities, and we anticipate this will continue as people adjust to their
    changing social realities. "
