  Article text: "In the first week of widespread global lockdown we decided to create
    a documentary series exploring the social impact of COVID-19 on Britain.\n\nThe
    resulting series, **The Corona Diaries**, was chosen for inclusion in the BFI’s
    **Britain in Lockdown** series of the best online videos made during the pandemic.
    \n\n\nIn The Corona Diaries we brought to life a diverse range of experiences,
    giving voice to people in different situations to tell their stories. In making
    the series we have seen marked shifts in attitudes, behaviours, values and priorities,
    and we anticipate this will continue as people adjust to their changing social
    realities. "
