- Article text: "We partnered with MLS to develop a communications strategy aimed
    at inspiring engagement with Unilever and DFIDâ€™s TRANSFORM programme.\n\n\nA cross-sector
    partnership between business, government, and civil-society, TRANSFORM aims to
    leverage respective strengths to address pressing development challenges across
    the world.\n\nWe uncovered the human stories and social impact that TRANSFORM
    social enterprises were making, and the benefit those organisations gained from
    working with Unilever teams. \n\nWe worked with MLS to develop a multi-channel
    comms plan to position TRANSFORM as a leading example of a public private partnership,
    encouraging and equipping other partners to replicate and invest in the model.\n"
