    **Impact documentaries, social content, research and communications strategic support - to reform discriminatory and archaic colonial laws.**

    We interviewed and immersed ourselves in the lives of activists, lawyers, legislators, faith leaders, world leaders and many of those affected by colonial-era laws.

    The films connected a powerful audience to change-makers and to those directly experiencing the human impact of inherited systemic legal failings, particularly LGBTQIA\+ people and women and girls.

    We developed a messaging and media strategy tailored to fit audiences across vastly different cultures. We extended the life of the film through cutdowns, short soundbite films and social media content to support HDTâ€™s online fundraising and advocacy.

    Filming in five countries and working for more than a year, the films were widely praised by creatives, activists and experts, and are now producing real-world impact.

  Testimonial: |-
    "Our partnership with The Good Side has been instrumental to our first foray into documentary films. The team combines audience insight and behaviour change strategy with a sensitive, thoughtful approach to filmmaking. The documentaries they produced with us have furthered our mission globally, and we have experienced genuine impact from their human-centred approach."
