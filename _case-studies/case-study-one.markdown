Case study title: Human Dignity Trust x The Good Side
Question: How might we appeal to Commonwealth leaders to understand the impact of
  discriminatory legislation and drive legal reform?

    We interviewed and immersed ourselves in the lives of activists, lawyers, legislators, faith leaders, world leaders and, most importantly, those affected by largely British colonial laws. These laws leave leave people unprotected against sexual violence, criminalise homosexuality and gender difference, and do not protect against hate-fueled violence. The films connected a powerful audience to change-makers and to those directly experiencing the human impact of inherited systemic legal failings, particularly LGBTQIA\+ people and women and girls.

    We developed a messaging and media strategy tailored to fit audiences across vastly different cultures. We extended the life of the film through cutdowns, short soundbite films and social media content to support HDTâ€™s online fundraising and advocacy.

    Filming in five countries and working for more than a year, the films were widely praised by creatives, activists and experts, and are now producing real-world impact.
